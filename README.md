# opengl_renderer

simple modern OpenGL 4.6 Renderer using SDL3.

Functionality for Textures, Models (gltf thanks to tiny gltf loader), Framebuffers, Shaders

Simply build using cmake

Note: 
Not all external libraries are used, that are inside of the lib folder. Those are there if I decide to update the project.
